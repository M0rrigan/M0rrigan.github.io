I've decided to start posting my activity on my blog. It holds me accountable physically, and gives me something to post here, which is good motivation to get it looking better.

C25K is an app I downloaded a while back. It's supposed to get you from not being a runner at all to being able to run a 5k.

5 minute warm up walk
Alternate 1 minute run, 1:30 walk for 20 minutes
5 minute cooldown walk

Time: ~30 minutes
Distance: ~2 miles
Calories:
Weather: High 60s, cloudy
Felt: Great
