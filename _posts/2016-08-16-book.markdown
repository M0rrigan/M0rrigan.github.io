The Woman In Black, by Susan Hill

Should you read it?: Yes.
[I'm not one for rating books. I view them as 'would I recommend it to a friend or not'.]

I'd been meaning to read this book for ages. I'd seen it recommended on many lists of good scary books, and I finally got around to it! This was a super enjoyable read.

It was short, only took me a couple of hours to get through. Try reading it on a cold night with a blanket and a cup of hot tea!

It wasn't what I would call 'scary', but it did have that spooky, chill-in-your-bones sort of vibe. There was a lot of anticipation of what would happen: will someone die? Will the woman in black appear again? Honestly what I imagined in my head was much scarier than what actually happened in the book, but that's how you know the author created a great atmosphere.

If you have any interest in spooky books, definitely give this one a read. It's well-written and not a worn out story.
